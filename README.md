# Comply Advantage Exercises

## General

Each sub-folder contains the code I have written to solve the associated problem.

You can see the code run by opening the `*.html` file in your browser and opening the Console in its Developer Tools.

Alternately you can execute the Javascript code directly by running `node *.js`.

## Tests

I wrote some basic unit tests, using two simple functions I wrote myself and/or `console.log` statements. The output is 'true' if the test passed, otherwise false.

## Fibonacci

### Fibonacci #2

* I would normally have used [ES6 modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules) for this exercise. However, Chrome doesn't support modules when opening an HTML file, and I wanted to make the reviewer's life easier by allowing the solution to work immediately when they open the fibonacci.html file.
